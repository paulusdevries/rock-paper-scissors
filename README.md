# rock-paper-scissors
Learning programming with python and the rock-paper-scissors game as casus
---
# Tkinter 
In this casus I used Tkinter to create a GUI version of the rock-paper-scissors game

The file name for the GUI version is `rock_paper_scissors_gui.py`

# Console version
In the first place I created this game as a console application.

The file name for that is `rock_paper_scissors.py`

# And the other stuff?
As you can see some other stuff in this repo, 
those files contain examples of code I wrote in the period I was learning python
--- what I'm still doing..
